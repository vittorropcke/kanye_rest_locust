Locust

Locust is an open-source load testing tool designed to simulate user behavior and measure the performance of web applications, APIs, and other systems. It allows developers and testers to identify bottlenecks, measure response times, and ensure that their systems can handle expected traffic levels.

Key Features
Python-Based: Test scenarios are written in Python, making it highly flexible and easy to customize.
Real-User Simulation: Simulates the behavior of real users with different patterns of access.
Web Interface: Provides a user-friendly web interface to monitor and control tests in real-time.
Scalability: Can run on a single machine or be distributed across multiple machines to simulate millions of users.
How It Works
Locust works by defining user behavior in Python scripts. These scripts specify the actions that virtual users will perform, such as making HTTP requests to specific endpoints. Once the script is ready, Locust can execute it and simulate thousands (or even millions) of users accessing the system simultaneously.

Installation
To install Locust, ensure you have Python installed on your system, then run:




pip install locust
Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a Locust test script:




from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class MyUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 5)  # Wait time between tasks (1 to 5 seconds)

    @task
    def get_homepage(self):
        self.client.get("/")  # Sends a GET request to the homepage

    @task
    def post_data(self):
        self.client.post("/submit", json={"key": "value"})  # Sends a POST request with JSON data
Save this script as locustfile.py and run the following command:


locust
Then, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8089 to configure the number of users and start the test.

Advanced Features
Distributed Testing: Run Locust in distributed mode to simulate a large number of users across multiple machines.
Custom User Behavior: Define multiple user classes to simulate different types of user interactions.
Integration with CI/CD: Automate performance testing as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
